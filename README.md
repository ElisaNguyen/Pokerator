# Pokerator - Unveil your inner Pokemon
The  Pokérator  is  an  automatic  generator  of new Pokémon names with descriptions based on  user  input.   The  names  are  generated  by blending words based on syllables (or characters if monosyllabic) and are evaluated using bigram  language  models.   The  description  is generated by retrieving words from ConceptNet and feeding these into templates, as well as using OpenAI’s GPT-2 language generatio n model,  which  is  trained  on  all  Pokédex  entries.
