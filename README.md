# Pokerator - Unveil your inner Pokemon
The  Pokérator  is  an  automatic  generator  of new Pokémon names with descriptions based on  user  input.   The  names  are  generated  by blending words based on syllables (or characters if monosyllabic) and are evaluated using bigram  language  models.   The  description  is generated by retrieving words from ConceptNet and feeding these into templates, as well as using OpenAI’s GPT-2 language generatio n model,  which  is  trained  on  all  Pokédex  entries.

This project has been developed in the frame of the Advanced Project in Natural Language Processing at the University of Twente. 
The project authors are Dominique Geissler (@domi151), Elisa Nguyen (@ElisaNguyen) and Daphne Theodorakopoulos (@daphne12345). 

This project contains the Python files, models and Python notebooks created.
